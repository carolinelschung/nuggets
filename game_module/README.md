### Game Module for the Nuggets Game
**Joseph Quaratiello**

This module serves as the core of the Nuggets game, managing the game state, player interactions, and gold distribution. It handles the initialization of the game environment, including loading the map, placing gold piles, and assigning players to unique positions. The game module processes player movements, updates the map based on actions, and ensures all players and spectators receive real-time updates. Key features include handling collisions, managing gold collection, and supporting a spectator view. It also supports a "plain mode" for simplified gameplay by disabling advanced features like gold stealing.
